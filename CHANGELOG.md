# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- wg-easy v15 compatibility: login now uses `POST /api/auth/password`, falling back to the old `POST /api/session` (v14 and Amnezia forks); the working endpoint is remembered and re-probed on server upgrades.

### Changed

- Users without access no longer receive any messages from the bot; unauthorized access attempts are only logged.

## [0.2.0b] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- Role-based access control: `admin` and `user` roles, configured via the `ADMIN_USERNAMES` and `USERNAMES` environment variables.
- Regular users only see, create, download and delete their own peers, within a per-user limit (default from `DEFAULT_CONFIG_LIMIT`, default 3).
- Admin user management from the bot: `/adduser` (forward a message from the user, or send `username [limit]`), `/users`, `/limit <username> <N>`, `/deluser <username>`.
- Automatic peer names: new peers are named `<username>_<random hash>`; search matches this pattern.
- SQLite user database (`USERS_DB_PATH`, default `users.db`) storing Telegram ID, username, role and config limit; mounted as a volume in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `ALLOWED_USERNAMES` is replaced by `ADMIN_USERNAMES` and `USERNAMES` — update your `.env` before upgrading.
- Peer creation no longer asks for a name: `/create` (or the menu button) generates a unique name immediately.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Peer rename function; rename, delete and get-config options are available after searching a peer.

### Fixed

- Cancel button during peer creation; pressed button names no longer leak into prompts.

### Changed

- Internal code deduplication.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- 401 error when working through insecure plain http connection.
- Confusing annotation for the WG Tunnel app.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Initial release: Telegram bot for managing wg-easy peers (list, create with custom Amnezia links, download, delete, search).
